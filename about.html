                <h4>Ride a Hot Air Balloon</h4>
                <p>Most visitors to Bohol make the trek to the viewing deck overlooking Chocolate Hills. Travel insiders, however, know that there are other ways of experiencing the tourist landmark. See the chocolate brown hills from a totally different perspective with a scenic early morning hot-air balloon ride. It’s a cooler experience.</p>

                <h4>Tarsiers</h4>
                <p>Let’s be honest: you want to go to Bohol because you want to see the smallest and cutest primate in the world. In addition to Chocolate Hills, the tarsier is one of Bohol’s biggest draws. The best place to see tarsiers is in their natural habitat, and the Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary is home to many of the adorable tarsiers that you’ll find in the heart of Bohol Island.</p>

                <h4>Scuba Diving at Alona Beach</h4>
                <p>Scuba diving in Bohol’s crystal blue waters is a fun way of experiencing nature. Learn some basic diving skills before you jump into the deep end. Get up close with tropical fish and sea turtles and swim above colorful coral. Explored reefs, wrecks, and caves. A seasoned diving instructor is always at your side.</p>

Explore exotic islands like Pamilacan, Balicasag, Isola di Francesco, and the crescent-shaped sandbar of Virgin Island. Meet friendly dolphins and go snorkeling in one of the country’s top diving spots.</p>
